	<p>I study the properties of neurons and synapses in the striatum using a powerful combination of electrophysiology, two-photon microscopy and optogenetics, both in vivo and ex vivo. We also take advantage of genetic tools, including viruses and transgenics, to characterize and manipulate specific neurons and connections.</p>
